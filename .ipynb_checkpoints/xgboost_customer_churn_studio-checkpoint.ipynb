We can use this historical information to train an ML model that can predict customer churn. After training the model, we can pass the profile information of an arbitrary customer (the same profile information that we used to train the model) to the model to have the model predict whether this customer will churn. \n",

It is attributed by the author to the University of California Irvine Repository of Machine Learning Datasets. The `data` folder that came with this notebook contains the dataset, which we've already preprocessed for this walkthrough. The dataset has been split into training and validation sets. To see how the dataset was preprocessed, see this notebook: [XGBoost customer churn notebook that starts with the original dataset](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/introduction_to_applying_machine_learning/xgboost_customer_churn/xgboost_customer_churn.ipynb). \n",

    "- `max_depth` Controls how deep each tree within the algorithm can be built.  Deeper trees can lead to better fit, but are more computationally expensive and can lead to overfitting.  Typically, you need to explore some trade-offs in model performance between a large number of shallow trees and a smaller number of deeper trees.\n",
    "- `subsample` Controls sampling of the training data.  This hyperparameter can help reduce overfitting, but setting it too low can also starve the model of data.\n",
    "- `num_round` Controls the number of boosting rounds.  This value specifies the models that are subsequently trained using the residuals of previous iterations.  Again, more rounds should produce a better fit on the training data, but can be computationally expensive or lead to overfitting.\n",
    "- `eta` Controls how aggressive each round of boosting is.  Larger values lead to more conservative boosting.\n",
    "- `gamma` Controls how aggressively trees are grown.  Larger values lead to more conservative models.\n",
    "- `min_child_weight` Also controls how aggresively trees are grown. Large values lead to a more conservative model.\n",
